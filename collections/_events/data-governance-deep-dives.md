This closed door event will bring together practitioners, researchers, academics, and other experts working on models to harness the value of data with the aim of redistributing power in the digital economy. 

The purpose of these discussions is to explore the different decisions, structures, technological choices and the lessons we as a community can draw from them. We hope these conversations can help move data stewardship out of the theoretical realm into reality, and examine its impact on communities and more broadly the data economy.
